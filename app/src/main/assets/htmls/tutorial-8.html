<p style="text-align: justify">Multiple access in 5G mobile networks is an emerging research topic, since it is key for the next generation network to keep pace with the exponential growth of mobile data and multimedia traffic. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has recently received considerable attention as a promising candidate for 5G multiple access. The key idea of NOMA is to exploit the power domain for multiple access, which means multiple users can be served concurrently at the same time, frequency, and spreading code. Instead of using water-filling power allocation strategies, NOMA allocates more power to the users with poorer channel conditions, with the aim to facilitate a balanced tradeoff between system throughput and user fairness. Recent industrial demonstrations show that the use of NOMA can significantly improve the spectral efficiency of mobile networks. Because of such a superior performance, NOMA has been also recently proposed for downlink scenarios in 3rd generation partnership project long-term evolution (3GPPLTE) systems, and the considering technique was termed multiuser superposition transmission (MUST). In this tutorial, we will provide a progress review for NOMA, including an information theoretic perspective of NOMA, the interaction between cognitive radio and NOMA, the design of MIMO and cooperative NOMA, and the impact of practical constraints, such as imperfect channel state information and limited feedback, on the performance of NOMA.</p>
