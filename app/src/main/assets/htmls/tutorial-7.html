<p style="text-align: justify">The demands on massive connectivity, large capacity and short delay for the next generation wireless communication networks (5G) drastically push the development of new type multiple access technology over the conventional orthogonal access technology. Recently, some new type non-orthogonal multiple access technologies such as sparse code multiple access (SCMA) proposed by Huawei, multiuser shared access (MUSA) proposed by ZTE proposed and pattern division multiple access (PDMA) proposed by Datang have attracted lots of attention and have been looked as the potential 5G New Air Interface Technologies. In this tutorial, I will make an extensive introduction to sparse code multiple access (SCMA), where I will majorly focus on the codebook design, sparse channel estimation, and decoder design. Meanwhile I will address some related problems such as grant free access, energy efficiency, intercell interference mitigation and capacity analysis for SCMA networks. By this tutorial, one can get full image of SCMA, the importance of SCMA, SCMA design and some open problems related to SCMA.</p>
