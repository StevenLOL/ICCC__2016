<h3>Title:<br/>
    <strong>Cell-Edge-Aware Precoding for Downlink Massive MIMO Cellular Networks</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br/>
    Tony Quek, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We propose a cell-edge-aware (CEA) zero forcing (ZF) precoder that
    exploits the excess spatial degrees of freedom provided by a large number of base station (BS)
    antennas to suppress inter-cell interference at the most vulnerable user equipments (UEs). We
    evaluate the downlink performance of CEA-ZF, as well as that of a conventional cell-edge-unaware
    (CEU) ZF precoder in a network with random base station topology. Our analysis and simulations
    show that the proposed CEA-ZF precoder outperforms CEU-ZF precoding in terms of (i) aggregate
    per-cell data rate, (ii) coverage probability, and (iii) 95%-likely, or edge user, rate. This
    result identifies CEA-ZF as a more effective precoding scheme for massive MIMO cellular
    networks. Our framework also reveals the importance of scheduling the optimal number of UEs per
    BS, and confirms the necessity to control the amount of pilot contamination received during the
    channel estimation phase.</p>

<h3>Title:<br/>
    <strong>Joint Codebook Assignment and Power Allocation for SCMA Based on Capacity with Gaussian
        Input</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br/>
    Wen Chen, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) is a nonorthogonal
    multi-dimensional spreading technique based on layered codebooks. In SCMA, incoming bits are
    directly mapped to multi-dimensional codewords of pre-defined codebooks. In comparison to simple
    repetition of QAM symbols in Low Density Signature (LDS), shaping gain of the multi-dimensional
    constellation is the main advantage of SCMA for performance improvement. Similar to LDS, SCMA
    can take the advantage of a near optimal Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) receiver with
    reasonable complexity. In this paper, the uplink SCMA sum capacity is derived and a specific
    codebook design method is proposed, which can cancel the effect of the dependency between the
    non-zero entries of codewords. Under this condition, we study the uplink sum-rate optimization
    problem. A joint codebook assignment and power allocation method is proposed to achieve a near
    optimal solution. Simulation results show the significant performance gain of the proposed
    algorithm.</p>

<h3>Title:<br/>
    <strong>Beam Training in Millimeter Wave Communication Systems</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br/>
    Yongming Huang, Southeast University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication recently has attracted
    increasing attention, as it promises realizing extremely high data rate owing to its abundant
    spectrum resource. Large antenna array is generally required to combat the severe path loss of
    mmWave channels. In particular, beam alignment is needed to search the best pairs of transmit
    and receive beams from a finite space which is usually represented by a beam training codebook.
    In this talk, we discuss efficient beam training for hybrid digital/analog MIMO mmWave systems.
    Particularly, we present a new design approach of hierarchical training codebook by shaping the
    pattern of multi-resolution training beams, by which multi-stage beam alignment can be carried
    out with high efficiency. We also provide performance analysis and reveal that the probability
    of missing alignment of this approach decreases exponentially with the increasing of SNR and the
    number of trainings. Numerical results finally confirm its effectiveness and show that this new
    approach achieves high accuracy beam alignment even in the low SNR regime.</p>
