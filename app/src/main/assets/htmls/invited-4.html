<strong>Complexity Metrics of High Security Sequence Based on Entropy Theory</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Zan Li, Xidian University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Nowadays, various jamming, tapping and other attacks become serious threats for the people��s information privacy in business and military applications. The security technologies, such as covert communication, computer science, cryptography, etc., face many new challenges in current daily life. As we know, these security technologies always employ the specific sequence, such as FH sequence, chaotic sequence, cryptographical sequence, etc., to resist attacks, and the complexity, which means the ability to avoid the sequence being reconstructed from the obtained sub-sequence available, is the most important indicator to reflect the sequence��s security. With the growing development in the design of sequence in much wider fields, the well-known complexity measures��the linear complexity (LC), the linear complexity profile (LCP) and the k-error linear complexity (k-error LC)��are widely used but not sufficient to evaluate the complexity of the sequences available, such as the cryptographical sequence and the chaotic sequence families. This talk will introduce some of our works on new complexity metrics of high security sequence based on approximate entropy (ApEn) and fuzzy entropy (FuEn), which make the complexity classification more exact with relatively small amount of data points, and are more robust than the existing complexity metrics. As a result, they could be effectively applied to optimize the sequence to achieve high complexity for the high security technologies.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>From NICE to CAO-SIR: Evolution of Half Duplex Wireless Networks</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Wei Chen, Tsinghua University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">When I was a visiting PhD student in HKUST, there are two dreams in wireless communications, i.e., to develop topology-free network coding and to recover multiplexing loss in half duplex relaying. It takes a decade for us to realize the two dreams, which are inherently connected, as I will show in this talk. In particular, a topology free network coding method, referred to as network interference cancellation or NICE, will be presented. It can make use of the prior knowledge about the interference, which an interfered node can obtain by overhearing the signals from the source node, to cancel the inference from the relays of a multi-hop flow. Based on NICE, we further propose a channel aware successive relaying protocol, also referred to as CAO-SIR, which is capable of thoroughly mitigating the inter-relay interference induced by successive relaying, thereby achieving the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of full duplex relaying asymptotically. In practice, NICE and CAO-SIR may benefit the evolution of half duplex wireless networks.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Achieving k-Channel-Connectivity with Topology Control in Cognitive Radio Networks</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Min Sheng, Xidian University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In view of the unpredictable activities of primary users (PUs), connectivity guarantee is of vital importance for the cognitive radio network (CRN). Existing works ensure the connectivity of the CRN with only one channel reclaimed by PU, without considering a general case that PUs occupy multiple channels simultaneously, thereby resulting in a network partition. In this paper, we aim at guaranteeing the k-channel-connectivity of the CRN, which refers to maintain the CRN&#8217;s connectivity even when any k-1 channels are requested by PUs at the same time. Particularly, we achieve the target by ensuring that any k-1 independent sets (i.e., groups of SUs that transmit on the same channel) are not any vertex-cut set of the CRN. With that guidance, we firstly propose a topology control algorithm to minimize the number of channels required by the CRN, and to ensures that the topology remains k-channel-connected and conflict-free as well. Secondly, the correctness of the proposed algorithm is verified via theoretical analysis. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that our algorithm can not only enables the reductions of the required channels, but also the power consumption of the CRN.</p>
