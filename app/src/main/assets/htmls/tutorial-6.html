<p style="text-align: justify">With 4G cellular technologies now beginning to be deployed widely around the world, the fifth generation (5G) mobile and wireless communication technologies are emerging into research fields. New services, applications and devices will drive requirements on data rate, ubiquity of data services, latency, cost, and reliability and further drive data traffic growth. Networks, services, and devices will be more heterogeneous and the need to connect billions of devices to the network will emerge. Despite the advances made in the design and evolution of 4G cellular networks, these new market trends are imposing unprecedentedly challenging requirements, which are driving us further to the necessity of a 5G mobile network. In this tutorial, we will introduce the targets and technical challenges in 5G networks and discuss the different networks and devices revolution that are essential to meet these challenges. In addition, we will provide a fundamental understanding and design of 5G networks through the effective use of these new network architectures and device capabilities. In conclusion, we will provide some recent advances in the research of 5G.</p>
