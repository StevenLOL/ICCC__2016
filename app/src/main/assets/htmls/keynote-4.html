<h3 style="text-align: center">A Hyper Cellular Architecture for 5G</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cellular concept was invented to improve the spectrum efficiency by spectrum reuse and has contributed a lot for the explosive deployment of today's mobile communication industry.  As mobile data and video traffic is fast growing, the next-generation mobile communication (5G) networks are expected to further provide 10-fold more capacity than 4G mobile networks with the limited spectrum as well as energy resources.  To deal with this challenge, the traditional physical- and MAC-layer capacity-enhancement approaches are no more sufficient and efficient.  A system- or network-level approach is needed, including rethinking about the existing cellular structure.  On the other hand, cellular networks are transforming from just a mobile communication platform to a smart information infrastructure on which more and more always-online type of traffic (e.g., short but frequent signaling packets of various social networks, sensing information of smart earth and smart community, control packets in cooperative heterogeneous wireless networks) need to be handled in an energy-efficient way.  As a result, the existing cellular framework should be revisited.</p>
    <p>In this talk, we propose a new cellular framework, named hyper-cellular architecture (HCA), aiming at increasing the whole network capacity by more than 10-fold based on the existing limited spectrum and energy resources as well as accommodating ever-increasing always-online traffic in a more energy-efficient way.  The key idea here is to separate the coverage of control signals from the coverage of data signals so that the data coverage can be more elastic in accordance with the dynamics of traffic needs and QoS requirements.  This can be considered as the further extension of the existing C-RAN concept and one of the key candidate technologies for 5G mobile communications systems.  Some preliminary results have shown that this new paradigm has a great potential in the capacity enhancement and energy savings.  Its software-defined implementation through the convergence of virtual BS and edge cloud technologies will also be discussed.</p>

During 1992-94, he worked for Fujitsu Laboratories Ltd., Japan, and in 1994 joined with Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, where he is now a professor at the Department of Electronic Engineering.  His major research interests include queueing theory, traffic engineering, mobile Internet, radio resource management of wireless networks, and green communication and networks. </p>
    <p>Dr. Niu has been an active volunteer for various academic societies, including Director for Asia-Pacific Board (2008-09), Director for Conference Publications (2010-11), and Chair of Emerging Technology Committee (2014-15) of IEEE Communication Society.  He also served as a distinguished lecturer (2012-15) of IEEE Communication Society and a distinguished lecturer (2014-16) of IEEE Vehicular Technologies Society. Dr. Niu received the Outstanding Young Researcher Award from Natural Science Foundation of China in 2009 and the Best Paper Award from IEEE Communication Society Asia-Pacific Board in 2013.  He also co-received the Best Paper Awards from the 13th, 15th and 19th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communication (APCC) in 2007, 2009, and 2013, respectively, International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP'13), and the Best Student Paper Award from the 25th International Teletraffic Congress (ITC25).  He is now the Chief Scientist of the National Basic Research Program (so called "973 Project") of China on "Fundamental Research on the Energy and Resource Optimized Hyper-Cellular Mobile Communication System" (2012-2016), which is the first national project on green communications in China.  He is a fellow of both IEEE and IEICE.</p>
