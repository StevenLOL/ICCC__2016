<h3 style="text-align: center">Multiple Access and Power Efficiency in Wireless Communications</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we focus on power efficiency which has been a major challenge in wireless communications for decades. We first give a brief review of some major advances in multicarrier transmission and multiple access techniques, which shaped the development of recent wireless communications standards. The review includes the development of OFDM and single-carrier transmission with frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) as well as the birth of OFDMA and of single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), which were adopted by the Mobile WiMAX and the 3GPP LTE standards. Next, we address the nonlinear distortion problems caused by the nonlinear characteristics of the high-power amplifier (HPA) used at the transmitter in wireless communications systems and describe the various techniques devised to compensate for this phenomenon in single-carrier and multicarrier transmission. We emphasize the fact that the optimum operating point of the power amplifier cannot be always achieved in practice due to the stringent spectral masks imposed. We describe ideal signal predistortion that is applicable to both single-carrier and multicarrier systems and then we discuss peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction for multicarrier systems. We point out an important result that the gain achieved in terms of PAPR does not directly translate in terms of transmitted signal power.</p>
